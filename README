Python program to train a neural network (using a
single training tuple):
Input: (1.0, 0.25, -0.5)
Outputs: 1.0, -1.0
All initial weights and biases chosen randomly in the range of (-1.0, 1.0).
The program displays the following:
-->Initial value of weights and biases
-->Number of iterations
-->Termination criterion
-->Final value of all weights and biases
